  			<div id="info"> In a nutshell, we are a corps of Dartmouth undergrads who provide virtual tutoring to classrooms that need it.

			Using virtual whiteboard, videochat and tablet technology, we digitally recreate the experience of tutoring someone side-by-side regardless of physical location.

			Currently, we target under-resourced school systems, but in the process of our work we hope to show that there is no reason why anyone in the world canâ€™t learn from anyone else in real time.

			If any of this resonates with you, <a href="http://www.boosttutors.com/apply"> please sign up to be a tutor! </a> We're only asking for an hour or two a week. Or, reach out to anyone on the <a href="http://www.boosttutors.com/team" > team page </a>. We'd love to hear from you.
